                        "standard": "Promote, Profit, Publish! Become the world authority you always knew you could be. You know it. We know it. And this is how the rest of the world catches up.\n\nMost authors get it wrong. They put the wrong steps in the wrong order, pinning all of their hopes, dreams, and money on the sale of the book. Experts on authority marketing know that publishing elevates your customer base in ways that are impossible through any other mechanism. In short, you establish yourself as the world authority on your topic first, creating a trust between you and your audience that allows you to write, and sell, whatever you want with ease and flow. Step one of this process takes your investment and cycles it right back into you, your image, your platform, your global presence. You can’t afford to keep the curtain closed. Your ticket to freedom is to position yourself as the go-to expert on your topic by way of your personal truth before you even attempt to sell a book.\nThe truth….\nIf you’re only about the money honey you’re in the wrong place. Platform building works, every time, because you pride yourself on authenticity. You build a social, global platform that is a transmutation of your soul and message. Your audience needs to experience a level of trust in you that is staggering (and rare) in today’s saturated, over-promising/under-delivering digital age. You can’t afford to blend in. Why do it backward and end up with an inventory of books in your basement and a negative balance in your account? Here’s what many publishing companies say vs. what they actually mean; “Become a best-selling author! (For like, a minute)… “Make money from your book! (But remember, you can’t keep it)…”Make your author dreams come true! (ish…)\nYou want to make a difference and an income. This is how you do it. As an authority on your topic, you’ll be positioned as a sought-after speaker and trusted teacher. Fans will find you, follow you and wait for you to offer them something. And you’ll have it ready to go.\n The result…..\nYou’ve done it. They know you. They love you. The time has come to give the people what they want- your book! Most publishing and book marketing companies take more than they give. Period. Sadly, by the time the powers that be are done divvying up the profits from your life’s work, you’re left with a negative ROI and a strong temptation to throw in the towel. Not here, that’s why we created this podcast.  We care about a little thing called “the ripple effect.” Your success leads to the successful transformations of other people. And that circles back around to work you can take pride in. So, we’ve figured out the formula that establishes you as a world authority, helps you release a best-selling book and does it at a fraction of the cost of other houses so that you actually get to keep most of the money you make. And then you rave about us to your friends. You win, we win, your audience wins. The crowd goes wild. The world is a better place.\nJoin bestselling author, platform building expert, and publishing company owner, Juliet Clark to learn the ins and outs of how to build a platform that serves you and your audience while making the world a better place!"

Samir isn’t only a seasoned startup founder and angel investor—he’s also the author of No Startup Hipsters: Build Scalable Technology Companies. I was blown away by Samir’s pinpoint business thinking and how it applies in equal measure to forging a thriving, meaningful business as well as crafting a memorable, important book. In today’s chat, Samir and I talk about ideal reader identification, author platforms, marketing campaigns, funding models, expanded content funnels, and so much more. Get prepared to learn a lot. After the show, find us on Twitter @WinningEdits or #authormba with your questions and comments. Enjoy!"

                "standard": "In this episode, we have Steve Scott, a renowned author, blogger, and podcaster, who has published over 50 books in three different niches. Steve's expertise lies in building a platform and leveraging it for massive success in Kindle book publishing.\nSteve initially ventured into Kindle publishing in February 2012 with the intention of driving traffic to his blog. However, he quickly realized the potential for generating income through his books. He then focused on an untapped niche that he was interested in and dedicated himself to writing in-depth books about habits. He leveraged his knowledge of internet marketing to give away free content and build an email list, which became instrumental in building his platform and achieving Kindle publishing success.\nThroughout the episode, Steve shares his experiences and strategies for success in Amazon book publishing. He emphasizes the importance of understanding micro-topics, creating valuable content, and building an email list to promote and sell books. Steve also discusses the significance of launching books at a promotional price, utilizing email sequences, and continuously releasing new books to maintain momentum and attract readers.\nSteve's approach revolves around creating a platform that combines content marketing, email marketing, and Amazon's platform. He highlights the value of content upgrades, checklists, and leveraging platforms like SlideShare to reach a wider audience. Additionally, Steve emphasizes the importance of driving readers back to content and email lists, rather than solely focusing on social media.\nListeners can expect to gain valuable insights into building a successful platform, leveraging Amazon's platform, and implementing effective marketing strategies for Kindle book publishing. Steve's experience and expertise in the field make this episode a valuable resource for authors and aspiring self-publishers looking to achieve success on Amazon.\nWatch the free training: https://selfpublishing.com/freetrainingSchedule a no-cost call with our team: https://selfpublishing.com/schedule\n Here are some links that might come in handy:\n  Apply for a free book consultation  Register for our free on-demand training   \n\n Must-watch episodes:\n  SPS 044: Using A Free + Shipping Book Funnel with Anik Singal SPS 115: Using Atomic Habits To Write & Publish A Book with James Clear SPS 127: Traditional vs. Self Publishing: Which You Should Choose with Ruth Soukup  SPS 095: The Five Love Languages: Selling 15 Million Copies with Gary Chapman SPS 056: How I Sold 46M Copies of My Self Published Book with Robert Kiyosaki"

                "standard": "Promote, Profit, Publish! Become the world authority you always knew you could be. You know it. We know it. And this is how the rest of the world catches up.\n\nMost authors get it wrong. They put the wrong steps in the wrong order, pinning all of their hopes, dreams, and money on the sale of the book. Experts on authority marketing know that publishing elevates your customer base in ways that are impossible through any other mechanism. In short, you establish yourself as the world authority on your topic first, creating a trust between you and your audience that allows you to write, and sell, whatever you want with ease and flow. Step one of this process takes your investment and cycles it right back into you, your image, your platform, your global presence. You can’t afford to keep the curtain closed. Your ticket to freedom is to position yourself as the go-to expert on your topic by way of your personal truth before you even attempt to sell a book.\nThe truth….\nIf you’re only about the money honey you’re in the wrong place. Platform building works, every time, because you pride yourself on authenticity. You build a social, global platform that is a transmutation of your soul and message. Your audience needs to experience a level of trust in you that is staggering (and rare) in today’s saturated, over-promising/under-delivering digital age. You can’t afford to blend in. Why do it backward and end up with an inventory of books in your basement and a negative balance in your account? Here’s what many publishing companies say vs. what they actually mean; “Become a best-selling author! (For like, a minute)… “Make money from your book! (But remember, you can’t keep it)…”Make your author dreams come true! (ish…)\nYou want to make a difference and an income. This is how you do it. As an authority on your topic, you’ll be positioned as a sought-after speaker and trusted teacher. Fans will find you, follow you and wait for you to offer them something. And you’ll have it ready to go.\n The result…..\nYou’ve done it. They know you. They love you. The time has come to give the people what they want- your book! Most publishing and book marketing companies take more than they give. Period. Sadly, by the time the powers that be are done divvying up the profits from your life’s work, you’re left with a negative ROI and a strong temptation to throw in the towel. Not here, that’s why we created this podcast.  We care about a little thing called “the ripple effect.” Your success leads to the successful transformations of other people. And that circles back around to work you can take pride in. So, we’ve figured out the formula that establishes you as a world authority, helps you release a best-selling book and does it at a fraction of the cost of other houses so that you actually get to keep most of the money you make. And then you rave about us to your friends. You win, we win, your audience wins. The crowd goes wild. The world is a better place.\nJoin bestselling author, platform building expert, and publishing company owner, Juliet Clark to learn the ins and outs of how to build a platform that serves you and your audience while making the world a better place!"

If you think Show, don’t Tell is just tired writing advice, prepare to have your eyes opened as I break down the process of applying this key technique in both fiction and nonfiction books, sharing step-by-step actions each week you can take immediately to get closer each week to your wildest writing dreams, whether you’re writing your first book, or your tenth, all while making the process inspiring and fun. \n\nIf you want your book to get published, read, loved, and shared with readers all over the world, I’ll address the questions that are sooo hard to find answers for. \n\nIs your writing good enough to be published in today’s market? What are the unwritten rules that can make agents, publishers, and readers give your book 5-star reviews? Do you have what it takes to make it as a writer? Hint: You definitely do, but nobody is born knowing how to write a terrific book, so join us to give yourself an advantage over all the other books out there by adding to your writing skills, and getting the straight goods on the industry. \n\nIn this weekly show, I’ll bring you writing techniques, best practices, motivation, inspirational stories from real live authors out there making it in the world, and actionable advice that can help you turn that book you’re writing into the bestseller you know deep down that it can be. I’ll even share the tangible, step-by-step writing advice that I used to escape her daily grind of being a corporate executive to make a living doing all things writing, and living my best creative life. I’ll be interviewing top writing experts and authors who give you the straight goods on what it takes to make it as a writer. Knowing these writing truths has given me the opportunity to work with thousands of writers over the past decade who have seen their writing dreams come true, and doors open for them that they hadn’t even thought of when they started their journey.\n\nIf you’re ready to stop spinning your wheels on your book’s draft and get serious about making your writing the best it can be, don't miss an episode – subscribe or follow today, and visit my website at www.suzyvadori.com for more writing resources and updates."

                        "standard": "Promote, Profit, Publish! Become the world authority you always knew you could be. You know it. We know it. And this is how the rest of the world catches up.\n\nMost authors get it wrong. They put the wrong steps in the wrong order, pinning all of their hopes, dreams, and money on the sale of the book. Experts on authority marketing know that publishing elevates your customer base in ways that are impossible through any other mechanism. In short, you establish yourself as the world authority on your topic first, creating a trust between you and your audience that allows you to write, and sell, whatever you want with ease and flow. Step one of this process takes your investment and cycles it right back into you, your image, your platform, your global presence. You can’t afford to keep the curtain closed. Your ticket to freedom is to position yourself as the go-to expert on your topic by way of your personal truth before you even attempt to sell a book.\nThe truth….\nIf you’re only about the money honey you’re in the wrong place. Platform building works, every time, because you pride yourself on authenticity. You build a social, global platform that is a transmutation of your soul and message. Your audience needs to experience a level of trust in you that is staggering (and rare) in today’s saturated, over-promising/under-delivering digital age. You can’t afford to blend in. Why do it backward and end up with an inventory of books in your basement and a negative balance in your account? Here’s what many publishing companies say vs. what they actually mean; “Become a best-selling author! (For like, a minute)… “Make money from your book! (But remember, you can’t keep it)…”Make your author dreams come true! (ish…)\nYou want to make a difference and an income. This is how you do it. As an authority on your topic, you’ll be positioned as a sought-after speaker and trusted teacher. Fans will find you, follow you and wait for you to offer them something. And you’ll have it ready to go.\n The result…..\nYou’ve done it. They know you. They love you. The time has come to give the people what they want- your book! Most publishing and book marketing companies take more than they give. Period. Sadly, by the time the powers that be are done divvying up the profits from your life’s work, you’re left with a negative ROI and a strong temptation to throw in the towel. Not here, that’s why we created this podcast.  We care about a little thing called “the ripple effect.” Your success leads to the successful transformations of other people. And that circles back around to work you can take pride in. So, we’ve figured out the formula that establishes you as a world authority, helps you release a best-selling book and does it at a fraction of the cost of other houses so that you actually get to keep most of the money you make. And then you rave about us to your friends. You win, we win, your audience wins. The crowd goes wild. The world is a better place.\nJoin bestselling author, platform building expert, and publishing company owner, Juliet Clark to learn the ins and outs of how to build a platform that serves you and your audience while making the world a better place!"

Samir isn’t only a seasoned startup founder and angel investor—he’s also the author of No Startup Hipsters: Build Scalable Technology Companies. I was blown away by Samir’s pinpoint business thinking and how it applies in equal measure to forging a thriving, meaningful business as well as crafting a memorable, important book. In today’s chat, Samir and I talk about ideal reader identification, author platforms, marketing campaigns, funding models, expanded content funnels, and so much more. Get prepared to learn a lot.

                "standard": "In this episode, we have Steve Scott, a renowned author, blogger, and podcaster, who has published over 50 books in three different niches. Steve's expertise lies in building a platform and leveraging it for massive success in Kindle book publishing.\nSteve initially ventured into Kindle publishing in February 2012 with the intention of driving traffic to his blog. However, he quickly realized the potential for generating income through his books. He then focused on an untapped niche that he was interested in and dedicated himself to writing in-depth books about habits. He leveraged his knowledge of internet marketing to give away free content and build an email list, which became instrumental in building his platform and achieving Kindle publishing success.\nThroughout the episode, Steve shares his experiences and strategies for success in Amazon book publishing. He emphasizes the importance of understanding micro-topics, creating valuable content, and building an email list to promote and sell books. Steve also discusses the significance of launching books at a promotional price, utilizing email sequences, and continuously releasing new books to maintain momentum and attract readers.\nSteve's approach revolves around creating a platform that combines content marketing, email marketing, and Amazon's platform. He highlights the value of content upgrades, checklists, and leveraging platforms like SlideShare to reach a wider audience. Additionally, Steve emphasizes the importance of driving readers back to content and email lists, rather than solely focusing on social media.\nListeners can expect to gain valuable insights into building a successful platform, leveraging Amazon's platform, and implementing effective marketing strategies for Kindle book publishing. Steve's experience and expertise in the field make this episode a valuable resource for authors and aspiring self-publishers looking to achieve success on Amazon.\nWatch the free training: https://selfpublishing.com/freetrainingSchedule a no-cost call with our team: https://selfpublishing.com/schedule\n Here are some links that might come in handy:\n  Apply for a free book consultation  Register for our free on-demand training   \n\n Must-watch episodes:\n  SPS 044: Using A Free + Shipping Book Funnel with Anik Singal SPS 115: Using Atomic Habits To Write & Publish A Book with James Clear SPS 127: Traditional vs. Self Publishing: Which You Should Choose with Ruth Soukup  SPS 095: The Five Love Languages: Selling 15 Million Copies with Gary Chapman SPS 056: How I Sold 46M Copies of My Self Published Book with Robert Kiyosaki"
