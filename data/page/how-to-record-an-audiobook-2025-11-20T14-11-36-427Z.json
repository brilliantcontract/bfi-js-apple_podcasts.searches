In the process, I have identified key steps when it comes to streamlining the process. Here are eight steps to recording your first audiobook.\n Step 1  Record it. There are a few different strategies for this step, and I'll unpack those for you.\n Step 2  Edit. Whether you do it yourself or outsource it, it is a necessary step.\n Step 3 Quality Control and Review. Get a friend to listen, read, and note any errors.\n Step 4 Make the Changes. Go back and make the changes. There is one vital piece, and I'll share that with you.\n Step 5 Have someone else listen to it. Another round of edits can make all the difference.\n Step 6 Add something, not in the written version. Listeners love an easter egg.\n Step 7 Run it through auphonic.com.\n Step 8 Submit it to ACX.\n It is a long process, and there are many sub-steps within each piece. With this outline, you will save yourself lots of time in the long run.\n Resources:\n auphonic.com\n ACX\n Connect with Jody:\n www.jodymaberry.com\n Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/sugarjmaberry\n LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jodymaberry/\n Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/sugarjmaberry/"

When I arrived, he actually had a video camera set up to record my reactions! Of course, it wasn't until later I realized he was hoping his slut wife would do more than watch. I did, too! I had a mouth, a pussy, and an ass all ready for the four big dancers, and my husband caught it all on tape. Now, he's got the video so he can tell everyone, \"watch my wife!\"\n\nThat night, though, all he could say was, \"F**k my Wife!\" and nobody needed to be told twice.\n\nWarning: This audiobook contains very explicit descriptions of a husband recording a wife share gangbang. It includes oral sex, forced deep throat, anal sex, double penetration, and forced semen swallowing. It is intended for mature listeners who will not be offended by graphic representations of sex acts between consenting adults.\n\nContact: info@hotaudiobook.com"

Too often, they are promoted  because of their true sales skills but get trapped doing their old  sales job while trying to do their new manager job.  These  sales managers are the forgotten rookies. They get the least amount  of training of any employee in a company and their success in  selling doesnt always translate into success in sales  management.   The Accidental Sales Manager explains the Sales  Management Trap which focuses the manager on doing the  things in Stages Three and Four instead of getting trapped in  Stages One and Two that burns time and exhausts them.  Chris Lytle believes learning is something that the salesperson  must actively participate in. The Accidental Sales Manager  will teach managers how they can apply learning to their industry  and marketplace. For example, instead of standing at the end of the  conference table talking, the sales manager poses questions and  involves the salespeople in a high level conversation about what  works and doesnt work. Sales managers will learn other  helpful steps in these The Accidental Sales Manager  chapters:    Step 1: What Happens In Vegas Stays In Vegas  Step 2: One Good Idea Is Not Enough. But One Good Idea Is About  All Anyone Can Execute  Step 3: In This Sped Up World, The Only Way For Learning To Get  Traction Is To Slow Down    Step 4: Socrates Was Right, But You Never Met Him  Step 5: Whats Wrong With Internet Learning Today?"

                "standard": "Audiobooks are one of the most popular forms of experiencing a book, one of the most accessed and bought formats of books because of the convenience that they allow readers to have.\n\nWhy would you want to make your own audiobook? Well, many reasons: to increase your book sales, to give a more personal feeling to your book to readers, or simply to have fun narrating your own story, or someone else´s, and this book shows you just that!\n\n\nJennifer Lieberman, author of “The Year of the WHAT?!“, is one of our favorite writers because she knows how to talk to the reader through her easy to understand narrative and this book is no different. Organized in a very simple and practical way, this short guide is a solid crash-course for all of those who want to make their own audiobook but have no clue whatsoever on where to start.\n\nA great thing about this book is Jennifer’s approach to it. Jennifer clearly knows how writers think and the insecurities that most writers have when it comes to their own works and their own abilities, and she approaches this book not only conversationally but also in a motivating way, pushing the target reader’s back in order for them to try it out while she goes with them through the simplified 7 step process of making the audiobook, and that is super cool.\n\nThis step-by-step guide can be read in less than 30min, but it wasn’t designed, or written just to read, as you will see.\n\nJennifer doesn’t sugarcoat it when she talks about how long the process might take and that we have to be patient on ourselves and fight our own self-doubt. She doesn’t promise a one-step-miracle guide, but she does show us what we need to do, and tells this from her own experience and not because she read it somewhere else.\n\nShe warns about the preparation needed to record an audiobook, how to prep our voice, and she remind us how important and lengthy this will be into itself.\nVocal exercises for at least a month, before start recording. Yes, she tells us that and explains why, and for those who never recorded an audiobook, we had no clue that this was “a thing”, and this speaks volumes.\n\n\n\nFull written review - https://scribblesworth.wordpress.com/2021/12/17/how-to-record-and-publish-your-own-audiobook-by-jennifer-lieberman/\n\nCover Score: 7.0/10\nBook score: 9.5/10\nGet your copy on Amazon"

Too often, they are promoted  because of their true sales skills but get trapped doing their old  sales job while trying to do their new manager job.  These  sales managers are the forgotten rookies. They get the least amount  of training of any employee in a company and their success in  selling doesnt always translate into success in sales  management.   The Accidental Sales Manager explains the Sales  Management Trap which focuses the manager on doing the  things in Stages Three and Four instead of getting trapped in  Stages One and Two that burns time and exhausts them.  Chris Lytle believes learning is something that the salesperson  must actively participate in. The Accidental Sales Manager  will teach managers how they can apply learning to their industry  and marketplace. For example, instead of standing at the end of the  conference table talking, the sales manager poses questions and  involves the salespeople in a high level conversation about what  works and doesnt work. Sales managers will learn other  helpful steps in these The Accidental Sales Manager  chapters:    Step 1: What Happens In Vegas Stays In Vegas  Step 2: One Good Idea Is Not Enough. But One Good Idea Is About  All Anyone Can Execute  Step 3: In This Sped Up World, The Only Way For Learning To Get  Traction Is To Slow Down    Step 4: Socrates Was Right, But You Never Met Him  Step 5: Whats Wrong With Internet Learning Today?"

                "standard": "I have had the pleasure of helping to record and produce four audiobooks over the past few years. In the process, I have identified key steps when it comes to streamlining the process. Here are eight steps to recording your first audiobook.\n Step 1  Record it. There are a few different strategies for this step, and I'll unpack those for you.\n Step 2  Edit. Whether you do it yourself or outsource it, it is a necessary step.\n Step 3 Quality Control and Review. Get a friend to listen, read, and note any errors.\n Step 4 Make the Changes. Go back and make the changes. There is one vital piece, and I'll share that with you.\n Step 5 Have someone else listen to it. Another round of edits can make all the difference.\n Step 6 Add something, not in the written version. Listeners love an easter egg.\n Step 7 Run it through auphonic.com.\n Step 8 Submit it to ACX.\n It is a long process, and there are many sub-steps within each piece. With this outline, you will save yourself lots of time in the long run.\n Resources:\n auphonic.com\n ACX\n Connect with Jody:\n www.jodymaberry.com\n Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/sugarjmaberry\n LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jodymaberry/\n Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/sugarjmaberry/"

When I arrived, he actually had a video camera set up to record my reactions! Of course, it wasn't until later I realized he was hoping his slut wife would do more than watch. I did, too! I had a mouth, a pussy, and an ass all ready for the four big dancers, and my husband caught it all on tape. Now, he's got the video so he can tell everyone, \"watch my wife!\"\n\nThat night, though, all he could say was, \"F**k my Wife!\" and nobody needed to be told twice.\n\nWarning: This audiobook contains very explicit descriptions of a husband recording a wife share gangbang. It includes oral sex, forced deep throat, anal sex, double penetration, and forced semen swallowing. It is intended for mature listeners who will not be offended by graphic representations of sex acts between consenting adults.\n\nContact: info@hotaudiobook.com"

Too often, they are promoted  because of their true sales skills but get trapped doing their old  sales job while trying to do their new manager job.  These  sales managers are the forgotten rookies. They get the least amount  of training of any employee in a company and their success in  selling doesnt always translate into success in sales  management.   The Accidental Sales Manager explains the Sales  Management Trap which focuses the manager on doing the  things in Stages Three and Four instead of getting trapped in  Stages One and Two that burns time and exhausts them.  Chris Lytle believes learning is something that the salesperson  must actively participate in. The Accidental Sales Manager  will teach managers how they can apply learning to their industry  and marketplace. For example, instead of standing at the end of the  conference table talking, the sales manager poses questions and  involves the salespeople in a high level conversation about what  works and doesnt work. Sales managers will learn other  helpful steps in these The Accidental Sales Manager  chapters:    Step 1: What Happens In Vegas Stays In Vegas  Step 2: One Good Idea Is Not Enough. But One Good Idea Is About  All Anyone Can Execute  Step 3: In This Sped Up World, The Only Way For Learning To Get  Traction Is To Slow Down    Step 4: Socrates Was Right, But You Never Met Him  Step 5: Whats Wrong With Internet Learning Today?"

                "standard": "Audiobooks are one of the most popular forms of experiencing a book, one of the most accessed and bought formats of books because of the convenience that they allow readers to have.\n\nWhy would you want to make your own audiobook? Well, many reasons: to increase your book sales, to give a more personal feeling to your book to readers, or simply to have fun narrating your own story, or someone else´s, and this book shows you just that!\n\n\nJennifer Lieberman, author of “The Year of the WHAT?!“, is one of our favorite writers because she knows how to talk to the reader through her easy to understand narrative and this book is no different. Organized in a very simple and practical way, this short guide is a solid crash-course for all of those who want to make their own audiobook but have no clue whatsoever on where to start.\n\nA great thing about this book is Jennifer’s approach to it. Jennifer clearly knows how writers think and the insecurities that most writers have when it comes to their own works and their own abilities, and she approaches this book not only conversationally but also in a motivating way, pushing the target reader’s back in order for them to try it out while she goes with them through the simplified 7 step process of making the audiobook, and that is super cool.\n\nThis step-by-step guide can be read in less than 30min, but it wasn’t designed, or written just to read, as you will see.\n\nJennifer doesn’t sugarcoat it when she talks about how long the process might take and that we have to be patient on ourselves and fight our own self-doubt. She doesn’t promise a one-step-miracle guide, but she does show us what we need to do, and tells this from her own experience and not because she read it somewhere else.\n\nShe warns about the preparation needed to record an audiobook, how to prep our voice, and she remind us how important and lengthy this will be into itself.\nVocal exercises for at least a month, before start recording. Yes, she tells us that and explains why, and for those who never recorded an audiobook, we had no clue that this was “a thing”, and this speaks volumes.\n\n\n\nFull written review - https://scribblesworth.wordpress.com/2021/12/17/how-to-record-and-publish-your-own-audiobook-by-jennifer-lieberman/\n\nCover Score: 7.0/10\nBook score: 9.5/10\nGet your copy on Amazon"

Too often, they are promoted  because of their true sales skills but get trapped doing their old  sales job while trying to do their new manager job.  These  sales managers are the forgotten rookies. They get the least amount  of training of any employee in a company and their success in  selling doesnt always translate into success in sales  management.   The Accidental Sales Manager explains the Sales  Management Trap which focuses the manager on doing the  things in Stages Three and Four instead of getting trapped in  Stages One and Two that burns time and exhausts them.  Chris Lytle believes learning is something that the salesperson  must actively participate in. The Accidental Sales Manager  will teach managers how they can apply learning to their industry  and marketplace. For example, instead of standing at the end of the  conference table talking, the sales manager poses questions and  involves the salespeople in a high level conversation about what  works and doesnt work. Sales managers will learn other  helpful steps in these The Accidental Sales Manager  chapters:    Step 1: What Happens In Vegas Stays In Vegas  Step 2: One Good Idea Is Not Enough. But One Good Idea Is About  All Anyone Can Execute  Step 3: In This Sped Up World, The Only Way For Learning To Get  Traction Is To Slow Down    Step 4: Socrates Was Right, But You Never Met Him  Step 5: Whats Wrong With Internet Learning Today?"
