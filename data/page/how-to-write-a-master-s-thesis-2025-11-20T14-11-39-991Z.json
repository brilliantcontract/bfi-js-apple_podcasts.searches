They discussed how to record your thesis, when to review it ... and what to do if its broken.\nIn this episode we’re going to put it all together and understand the ingredients that go into a thesis. Because it's like a recipe - you don’t want to go too heavy on one ingredient. If you understand the company really well, but don’t understand the competitors you could make the wrong investing decision.\nHere's the stock pitch guide that Alec and Bryce talked about too. \nOrder the book on Booktopia or Amazon now. \nIf you want to let Alec or Bryce know what you think of an episode, contact them here. \nMake sure you don't miss anything about Equity Mates - sign up to our email list here. \nWant more Equity Mates?

The idea was to find songs that made me feel focused, but not edgy, with a tendency towards gentle dissonance and rhythms that are so subtle they almost disappear. Usually I listen to really emotional or intense bangers at all hours of the day, and while I wouldn't call this an \"ambient\" mix, it's as close as I'm likely to get, with a balance of quiet jazz, abstract electronics, and a bit of New Age synth stuff. I hope that, for those of you heading \"back to school\" this semester, it will get you in the headspace to read and write a lot without falling into the vortex of panic, stress, and bewilderment. – @max-pearl-bk\n\nTracklist: https://mmarzmix.com/081"

We discuss how much of the research was done before Rico and his coauthors started writing the paper. We also learn about their co-creation process of writing in work sessions through videoconferencing.\n\nAnother topic we discuss is what Rico experienced as the easiest and hardest parts of the process, as well as how much time the group of authors took to write the article.\n\nIn addition, we discussed the steps of the manuscript submission system, and some particularities of some journals such as requiring a cover letter and suggesting reviewers.\n\nWe round off discussing what Rico might have done different in hindsight.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Rico asks Eva about her experience in writing her first journal paper, and what she remembers of the process. For Eva, writing the first paper was certainly a longer process than for Rico.\n\nReferences\nInkscapePhD Talk for AcademicTransfer: Don’t make these nine mistakes when you write a journal paperFrom PhD Thesis to Journal Papers"

They discussed how to record your thesis, when to review it ... and what to do if its broken.\nIn this episode we’re going to put it all together and understand the ingredients that go into a thesis. Because it's like a recipe - you don’t want to go too heavy on one ingredient. If you understand the company really well, but don’t understand the competitors you could make the wrong investing decision.\nHere's the stock pitch guide that Alec and Bryce talked about too. \nOrder the book on Booktopia or Amazon now. \nIf you want to let Alec or Bryce know what you think of an episode, contact them here. \nMake sure you don't miss anything about Equity Mates - sign up to our email list here. \nWant more Equity Mates?

The idea was to find songs that made me feel focused, but not edgy, with a tendency towards gentle dissonance and rhythms that are so subtle they almost disappear. Usually I listen to really emotional or intense bangers at all hours of the day, and while I wouldn't call this an \"ambient\" mix, it's as close as I'm likely to get, with a balance of quiet jazz, abstract electronics, and a bit of New Age synth stuff. I hope that, for those of you heading \"back to school\" this semester, it will get you in the headspace to read and write a lot without falling into the vortex of panic, stress, and bewilderment. – @max-pearl-bk\n\nTracklist: https://mmarzmix.com/081"

We discuss how much of the research was done before Rico and his coauthors started writing the paper. We also learn about their co-creation process of writing in work sessions through videoconferencing.\n\nAnother topic we discuss is what Rico experienced as the easiest and hardest parts of the process, as well as how much time the group of authors took to write the article.\n\nIn addition, we discussed the steps of the manuscript submission system, and some particularities of some journals such as requiring a cover letter and suggesting reviewers.\n\nWe round off discussing what Rico might have done different in hindsight.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Rico asks Eva about her experience in writing her first journal paper, and what she remembers of the process. For Eva, writing the first paper was certainly a longer process than for Rico.\n\nReferences\nInkscapePhD Talk for AcademicTransfer: Don’t make these nine mistakes when you write a journal paperFrom PhD Thesis to Journal Papers"
