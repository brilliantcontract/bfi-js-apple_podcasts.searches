The Nerd Journey podcast helps explore alternative roles, increase job satisfaction, and accelerate career progression. Each week, we uncover patterns of technical career progression by dissecting careers of guests and discussing different job roles they’ve held, or discussing relevant career topics.  We’ve interviewed people in IT operations, sales engineering, technical marketing, product management, people management, network engineering, cybersecurity, software development, entrepreneurs, and more. We also discuss improving job satisfaction and accelerating career growth.  We are John White and Nick Korte, two technologists with experience in IT operations and sales engineering who started this podcast in 2018. We release on Tuesdays, and can be found at https://nerd-journey.com."

Matt's not your average writer; he's spent a whopping 13 years and close to 25,000 hours diving deep into the world of technical writing, copywriting, editing, and content creation.\n\n\n\nPicture this - from churning out user guides for a massive $12M software launch to crafting courses on workplace safety and even whipping up catchy web copy for a major fast-food chain, Matt's pen has conquered diverse terrains.\n\n\n\nBut hold on, that's not all! In just a year, Matt's made some serious waves on LinkedIn. How serious, you ask? Well, he's racked up over 1.9 million impressions with a slew of posts. That's huge! Plus, he's clinched a spot on Favikon's 🇨🇦Top 200 Creator rankings. And guess what? He's even caught the eye of big-name creators like Justin Welsh, Sam Browne🦖, and Dina Calakovic.\n\n\n\nBut beyond the impressive stats and accolades, what's really cool about Matt is the impact he's made on others. He's been the go-to guy for a frustrated creator who skyrocketed his reach and engagement in less than a month, just by following Matt's three simple tips. Then there's his client who struggled for months until Matt swooped in, clarified his messaging, revamped his content, and bam! Doubled his follower count in no time. And let's not forget the bunch of followers who swear by Matt's content for making theirs better.\n\n\n\nI can't wait for you all to hear Matt's story and the golden nuggets of wisdom he's got in store for us. Stay tuned, this is gonna be good"

Subscribe today to never miss a single daily episode!\n\nToday’s show teaches listeners about the importance of audio content and how it achieves the goal of both better inclusion (for those with physical or situational challenges) and reaches a larger audience.\n\nHosts Daphne and Fred share their spirited analysis of the article \"IT Professionals: Embrace Audio Content\" from the Curt Robbins & Associates Technical Writing Agency that was published on October 4, 2024.\n\nAn excerpt from the article: \"The two biggest reasons to adopt audio are the inclusion of additional social segments and use case scenarios and the resulting connection with a larger audience. Tens of millions of busy professionals listen to podcasts or other audio resources during times when they cannot read text or watch video, such as during driving or when exercising.\"\n\nCurt Robbins & Associates is currently taking on new clients. We enjoy helping companies with their documentation and communications strategy and implementation. Contact us to learn about our reasonable rates and fast turnaround."

Matt's not your average writer; he's spent a whopping 13 years and close to 25,000 hours diving deep into the world of technical writing, copywriting, editing, and content creation.\n\n\n\nPicture this - from churning out user guides for a massive $12M software launch to crafting courses on workplace safety and even whipping up catchy web copy for a major fast-food chain, Matt's pen has conquered diverse terrains.\n\n\n\nBut hold on, that's not all! In just a year, Matt's made some serious waves on LinkedIn. How serious, you ask? Well, he's racked up over 1.9 million impressions with a slew of posts. That's huge! Plus, he's clinched a spot on Favikon's 🇨🇦Top 200 Creator rankings. And guess what? He's even caught the eye of big-name creators like Justin Welsh, Sam Browne🦖, and Dina Calakovic.\n\n\n\nBut beyond the impressive stats and accolades, what's really cool about Matt is the impact he's made on others. He's been the go-to guy for a frustrated creator who skyrocketed his reach and engagement in less than a month, just by following Matt's three simple tips. Then there's his client who struggled for months until Matt swooped in, clarified his messaging, revamped his content, and bam! Doubled his follower count in no time. And let's not forget the bunch of followers who swear by Matt's content for making theirs better.\n\n\n\nI can't wait for you all to hear Matt's story and the golden nuggets of wisdom he's got in store for us. Stay tuned, this is gonna be good"
