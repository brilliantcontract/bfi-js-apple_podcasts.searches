                "standard": "Welcome to the first installment of our Autumn-ish Book Club! In this flash analysis series, we take an academic approach to some of the most talked-about books in Romantasy and fantasy today. With over 13 years of combined academic literary training, we bring a critical lens to fandom favorites while keeping the discussion fun, thought-provoking, and accessible.\n\nIn this episode, we’re discussing The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. We explore Katniss Everdeen as a heroine whose personality type makes her both powerful and vulnerable, how Peeta functions as a unique male main character (MMC), and why the series’ themes of power, media, and survival feel even more relevant today than when the books were first released. This is part 2 of this week's episode.\n\nThis season, we’ll be covering:\n\n\n  \nThe Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins\n\n  \nA Cruel Thirst by Angela Montoya\n\n  \nWhen the Moon Hatched by Sarah A. Parker\n\n  \nWhere the Shadows Meet by Patrice Caldwell\n\n  \nBlood of Hercules by Jasmin Mas\n\n  \nBlood Over Bright Haven by M.L. Wang\n\n  \nRed Queen by Victoria Aveyard\n\n  \nThe Jasad Heir by Sara Hashem\n\n\nAnd when book club wraps up, get ready! Our next full literary analysis will dive into Heir of Fire by Sarah J. Maas.\n\nIf you’re new here, we also have full seasons analyzing A Court of Thorns and Roses, A Court of Mist and Fury, A Court of Wings and Ruin, A Court of Frost and Starlight, House of Earth and Blood, House of Sky and Breath, Throne of Glass, and Crown of Midnight. Go back and check those out to see how we break down metaphors, symbolism, narrative structure, and character arcs through multiple literary lenses.\n\nPlus, we’re thrilled to announce our newest venture: The Subtext Society Journal—the first of its kind, dedicated to Romance, Romantasy, and fandom with an academic yet accessible voice. We’re publishing original essays and thought pieces, and we encourage listeners to submit their own articles for a chance to be featured.\n\nIf you love Sarah J. Maas, Romantasy, and deep literary analysis, you’re in the right place.\n\n\n\nShare your thoughts for a chance to be featured!

                "standard": "Welcome to Autumn-ish Book Club!\n\nIn this flash analysis series, we take an academic approach to some of the most talked-about books in Romantasy and fantasy today. With over 13 years of combined academic literary training, we bring a critical lens to fandom favorites while keeping the discussion fun, thought-provoking, and accessible.\n\nIn this episode, we’re discussing The Jasad Heir by Sara Hashem. We explore how Hashem intertwines Egyptian-inspired mythology with epic fantasy politics to tell a story of rebellion, identity, and survival. Through Sylvia’s journey as the last heir of a fallen kingdom forced into hiding, we analyze themes of legacy, vengeance, and the tension between duty and desire. We also unpack how Hashem uses slow-burn romance, political intrigue, and moral ambiguity to craft a richly layered debut that challenges traditional hero narratives within the Romantasy genre.\n\nThis episode is perfect for listeners looking for a Jasad Heir book discussion or in-depth Sara Hashem analysis, as we explore how her world-building, magic system, and character dynamics position her among the next generation of standout Romantasy authors. Whether you’re drawn to stories of secret royalty, forbidden love, or morally gray magic, this conversation dives deep into what makes The Jasad Heir a must-read for fantasy fans and BookTok readers alike.\n\n\n\nThis season, we’ll be covering:The Hunger Games by Suzanne CollinsA Cruel Thirst by Angela MontoyaWhen the Moon Hatched by Sarah A. ParkerWhere the Shadows Meet by Patrice CaldwellBlood of Hercules by Jasmin MasBlood Over Bright Haven by M.L. WangRed Queen by Victoria AveyardThe Jasad Heir by Sara Hashem\n\nAnd when book club wraps up, get ready—our next full literary analysis will dive into Heir of Fire by Sarah J. Maas.\n\nIf you’re new here, we also have full seasons analyzing A Court of Thorns and Roses, A Court of Mist and Fury, A Court of Wings and Ruin, A Court of Frost and Starlight, House of Earth and Blood, House of Sky and Breath, Throne of Glass, and Crown of Midnight. Go back and check those out to see how we break down metaphors, symbolism, narrative structure, and character arcs through multiple literary lenses.\nIf you love Sarah J. Maas, Sara Hashem, and smart, accessible Romantasy analysis, you’re in the right place.\n\n\n\nThe Subtext Society Journal: ⁠⁠⁠⁠https://thesubtextsocietyjournal.substack.com/⁠⁠⁠⁠ \n\nWe’re thrilled to announce our newest venture: The Subtext Society Journal—the first of its kind, dedicated to Romance, Romantasy, and fandom with an academic yet accessible voice.

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, particularly The Fellowship of the Ring. One academic study analyzes Frodo's journey through the lens of Joseph Campbell's monomyth, detailing how his quest aligns with stages like the call to adventure, supernatural aid, and atonement with the father. Another academic source and Reddit discussions examine the influences of various myths and legends, especially Norse and Arthurian, on Tolkien's world-building, while also addressing his complex and often debated stance on allegory versus applicability in his narratives. Furthermore, a literary analysis investigates the internal and external conflicts experienced by Frodo within the novel, such as his struggle against himself, other characters, nature, and societal norms. Reviews of The Fellowship of the Ring from critics like W.H. Auden and a Reddit user provide perspectives on the novel's pacing, world-building, prose, and structure, including the concept of Frodo's \"Homely Houses.\""

Terrorists deploy a range of communication methods and harness reliable communication theories to create strategic messages that persuade peaceful individuals to join their groups and engage in violence. While explaining how they accomplish this, the book lays out a blueprint for developing counter-messages perfectly designed to conquer such violent extremism and terrorism. Using this basis in persuasion theory, a socio-scientific approach is generated to fight terrorist propaganda and the damage it causes.\n--Describes four key theories and perspectives related to persuasion and how they relate to radicalization and counter-radicalization.\n--Identifies future challenges that security officials will face in trying to stop terrorist messaging from promoting violent radicalization.\n--Suggests future directions that security officials, researchers, and policymakers can take persuasion theory to develop effective counter-messaging campaigns.\nBeth Windisch is a national security practitioner.

                "standard": "Our guest this week is Dr. Jeannine Brown who’s got a new commentary out on Paul’s most popular epistle, Philippians! \n\nDr. Brown joins us to talk about Paul, Jesus, and a narrative understanding of the New Testament. Check it out, I think it was a fun conversation. \n\nThe letter to the Philippians illuminates a warm relationship between the apostle Paul and the Philippian believers. Despite difficult situations being experienced on both sides, Paul finds ample reason to celebrate what God in Christ has done and is doing in the believers' lives. Jeannine K. Brown's commentary on Philippians explores the themes of this epistle and how its message is still relevant to Christians in the twenty-first century. Brown shows how motifs of joy, contentment, and unity abound as Paul reminds the Philippians of the supreme value of knowing Jesus the Messiah, and she highlights their significance for shaping the contemporary church toward living more deeply in its identity in Christ. This Tyndale New Testament commentary examines the text section-by-section―exploring the context in which it was written, providing thoughtful commentary on the letter to the Philippians, and then unpacking its theology. It will leave you with a thorough understanding of the content and structure of Paul's writing, as well as its meaning and continued relevance. The Tyndale New Testament Commentaries are ideal resources for students and teachers of theology, as well as for preachers and individual Christians looking to delve deeper into the riches of Scripture. Insightful and comprehensive, Jeannine K. Brown's commentary on Philippians is a brilliant introduction that will give you a renewed appreciation for this rich Pauline epistle and a greater knowledge of why it is important to the Christian faith.\n\nJeannine K. Brown is professor of New Testament at Bethel Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. Her books include Scripture as Communication, The Gospels as Stories, and biblical commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew. She is also a coeditor of the second edition of The Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels. \n\nThis is a public episode.

He and Kyle discuss his background in product management and his experience scaling companies like Weebly and Vurb from startup to successful exit. Ryan also explains the importance of product market fit and how to determine if a product is meeting customer needs. We also explore the concept of feature market fit and the role of AI in analyzing user data. Ryan provides advice for aspiring founders and product managers and shares his recommendations for interesting podcasts and products. \nTakeaways\nPut in the time and gain experience in product management before starting a company.Product market fit is determined by how disappointed customers would be if the product no longer existed.Feature market fit is about understanding the importance of specific features to users, even if they are infrequently used.AI is revolutionizing product management by providing insights and analysis at scale.Consider using AI to analyze user data and gain deeper understanding of the product experience.Founders should focus on building enduring businesses and not just raising seed funding.Google Bard is an AI tool that has shown promise in providing accurate and real-time responses. OpenAI requires advanced prompt engineering and custom instructions, while Google provides more basic prompts and easier responses.Google's approach to product management focuses on polished consumer-grade experiences, while OpenAI's models require more hand-holding.The ease of use of AI models is becoming more apparent in Google's offerings, potentially impacting user preferences.The future outlook involves observing the race between OpenAI and Google in terms of mainstream adoption and product development.\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Background03:28 Getting into Product Management06:09 Starting as a Product Manager at Early Companies11:32 The Process of Patenting16:27 Understanding Product Market Fit20:03 The Importance of Feature Market Fit28:01 The Impact of AI on Product Management31:02 Incorporating AI into Product Insights42:24 Advice for Founding a Company47:18 Advice for Product Managers49:05 Interesting Recommendations50:12 Product Recommendations51:11 Comparison between OpenAI and Google52:42 Ease of Use and Product Management53:29 Conclusion and Future Outlook\nLinks from the Show:LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanglasgow/\nBooks: Competing Against Luck, Amp It Up\nWebsite: https://sprig.com/\n\nMore by Kyle:\nFollow Prodity on Twitter and TikTok\nFollow Kyle on Twitter and TikTok\nSign up for the Prodity Newsletter for more updates.\nKyle's writing on Medium\nProdity on Medium\nLike our podcast, consider Buying Us a Coffee or supporting us on Patreon"

                "standard": "After weeks of heavy, murder-laden cases, Isla takes us in a different, yet still crime-ridden, direction: the audacious world of rare book forgery.\nWe look at the incredible true story of Thomas James Wise, the celebrated 19th-century bibliophile who fooled collectors, museums, and even the British Museum itself. For decades, Wise posed as a gentleman scholar, building a reputation as England’s foremost rare book expert - while secretly forging first editions, inventing non-existent pamphlets, and even tearing pages out of priceless library books to perfect his scams.\nPlus: Dee and Isla take a detour into book-world quirks (yes, vellum, watermarks, and antique quiz questions all make an appearance), and wrap up with a themed Ink-quisition featuring author Claire Wilson’s Stephen King tattoo tribute.\nThis one proves that true crime doesn’t always need murder to shock and intrigue.\n👉 Listen now on all podcast platforms, YouTube, or via our website.SOURCES:\nThe Book Forger by Joseph Hone \nWikipedia\nUniversity of Oregon Book Blogs"

Meet Your Host... Katherine Burrows... Founder and CEO of Katherine Burrows Creative, creator of the Business Character Analysis, and Creative Content Strategist. As a lifelong writer and a professional copywriter for the last 12 years, I’ve noticed that so many coaches, speakers, and entrepreneurs really struggle to get the engagement and response they need from their content. That’s why I developed a really unique and powerful tool, specifically for entrepreneurs, speakers, and coaches, who are fed up with not achieving quality connections with their audience. Unlike a lot of other content creators, who still use formulas and metrics, I help my clients reveal the authentic character of themselves and their business, so their audience feels they identify with them instantly. If you’re finally ready to start building an authentic connection with your market, let’s have a cup of coffee and chat."

Or finished a heart-stopping scene only to look around and not be able to talk to anyone about it?

Book Talk for BookTok with Jac and Amy is the go-to literary podcast to discuss your favorite novels with your newest book-besties. They use their literary backgrounds to analyze what makes these stories so special and why the writing resonates with readers. Join them in taking modern women-written books seriously."

Meet Your Host... Katherine Burrows... Founder and CEO of Katherine Burrows Creative, creator of the Business Character Analysis, and Creative Content Strategist. As a lifelong writer and a professional copywriter for the last 12 years, I’ve noticed that so many coaches, speakers, and entrepreneurs really struggle to get the engagement and response they need from their content. That’s why I developed a really unique and powerful tool, specifically for entrepreneurs, speakers, and coaches, who are fed up with not achieving quality connections with their audience. Unlike a lot of other content creators, who still use formulas and metrics, I help my clients reveal the authentic character of themselves and their business, so their audience feels they identify with them instantly. If you’re finally ready to start building an authentic connection with your market, let’s have a cup of coffee and chat."

                "standard": "Welcome to the first installment of our Autumn-ish Book Club! In this flash analysis series, we take an academic approach to some of the most talked-about books in Romantasy and fantasy today. With over 13 years of combined academic literary training, we bring a critical lens to fandom favorites while keeping the discussion fun, thought-provoking, and accessible.\n\nIn this episode, we’re discussing The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. We explore Katniss Everdeen as a heroine whose personality type makes her both powerful and vulnerable, how Peeta functions as a unique male main character (MMC), and why the series’ themes of power, media, and survival feel even more relevant today than when the books were first released. This is part 2 of this week's episode.\n\nThis season, we’ll be covering:\n\n\n  \nThe Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins\n\n  \nA Cruel Thirst by Angela Montoya\n\n  \nWhen the Moon Hatched by Sarah A. Parker\n\n  \nWhere the Shadows Meet by Patrice Caldwell\n\n  \nBlood of Hercules by Jasmin Mas\n\n  \nBlood Over Bright Haven by M.L. Wang\n\n  \nRed Queen by Victoria Aveyard\n\n  \nThe Jasad Heir by Sara Hashem\n\n\nAnd when book club wraps up, get ready! Our next full literary analysis will dive into Heir of Fire by Sarah J. Maas.\n\nIf you’re new here, we also have full seasons analyzing A Court of Thorns and Roses, A Court of Mist and Fury, A Court of Wings and Ruin, A Court of Frost and Starlight, House of Earth and Blood, House of Sky and Breath, Throne of Glass, and Crown of Midnight. Go back and check those out to see how we break down metaphors, symbolism, narrative structure, and character arcs through multiple literary lenses.\n\nPlus, we’re thrilled to announce our newest venture: The Subtext Society Journal—the first of its kind, dedicated to Romance, Romantasy, and fandom with an academic yet accessible voice. We’re publishing original essays and thought pieces, and we encourage listeners to submit their own articles for a chance to be featured.\n\nIf you love Sarah J. Maas, Romantasy, and deep literary analysis, you’re in the right place.\n\n\n\nShare your thoughts for a chance to be featured! Submit them at ⁠⁠⁠⁠booktalkforbooktok.com⁠⁠⁠⁠ for a future mini-episode or exclusive Patreon discussion.\n\n\n\nThe Subtext Society Journal: ⁠https://thesubtextsocietyjournal.substack.com/⁠ \n\n\n\nSupport the Show: \n\nPatreon: ⁠⁠⁠⁠patreon.com/booktalkforbooktok⁠⁠⁠⁠ \n\nMerch: ⁠⁠⁠⁠Etsy Store⁠⁠⁠⁠\n\n\n\nFollow Us on Social: Instagram: @BookTalkForBookTok TikTok: @BookTalkForBookTok YouTube: @BookTalkForBookTok\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "standard": "Welcome to the first installment of our Autumn-ish Book Club! In this flash analysis series, we take an academic approach to some of the most talked-about books in Romantasy and fantasy today. With over 13 years of combined academic literary training, we bring a critical lens to fandom favorites while keeping the discussion fun, thought-provoking, and accessible.\n\nIn this episode, we’re discussing The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. We explore Katniss Everdeen as a heroine whose personality type makes her both powerful and vulnerable, how Peeta functions as a unique male main character (MMC), and why the series’ themes of power, media, and survival feel even more relevant today than when the books were first released. This is part 1 of this week's episode. Come back Thursday for part 2.\n\nThis season, we’ll be covering:\n\n\n  \nThe Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins\n\n\n\n  \nA Cruel Thirst by Angela Montoya\n\n\n\n  \nWhen the Moon Hatched by Sarah A. Parker\n\n\n\n  \nWhere the Shadows Meet by Patrice Caldwell\n\n\n\n  \nBlood of Hercules by Jasmin Mas\n\n\n\n  \nBlood Over Bright Haven by M.L. Wang\n\n\n\n  \nRed Queen by Victoria Aveyard\n\n\n\n  \nThe Jasad Heir by Sara Hashem\n\n\n\n\nAnd when book club wraps up, get ready! Our next full literary analysis will dive into Heir of Fire by Sarah J. Maas.\n\nIf you’re new here, we also have full seasons analyzing A Court of Thorns and Roses, A Court of Mist and Fury, A Court of Wings and Ruin, A Court of Frost and Starlight, House of Earth and Blood, House of Sky and Breath, Throne of Glass, and Crown of Midnight. Go back and check those out to see how we break down metaphors, symbolism, narrative structure, and character arcs through multiple literary lenses.\n\nPlus, we’re thrilled to announce our newest venture: The Subtext Society Journal—the first of its kind, dedicated to Romance, Romantasy, and fandom with an academic yet accessible voice. We’re publishing original essays and thought pieces, and we encourage listeners to submit their own articles for a chance to be featured.\n\nIf you love Sarah J. Maas, Romantasy, and deep literary analysis, you’re in the right place.\n\n\n\nShare your thoughts for a chance to be featured!

                "standard": "Welcome to Autumn-ish Book Club!\n\nIn this flash analysis series, we take an academic approach to some of the most talked-about books in Romantasy and fantasy today. With over 13 years of combined academic literary training, we bring a critical lens to fandom favorites while keeping the discussion fun, thought-provoking, and accessible.\n\nIn this episode, we’re discussing The Jasad Heir by Sara Hashem. We explore how Hashem intertwines Egyptian-inspired mythology with epic fantasy politics to tell a story of rebellion, identity, and survival. Through Sylvia’s journey as the last heir of a fallen kingdom forced into hiding, we analyze themes of legacy, vengeance, and the tension between duty and desire. We also unpack how Hashem uses slow-burn romance, political intrigue, and moral ambiguity to craft a richly layered debut that challenges traditional hero narratives within the Romantasy genre.\n\nThis episode is perfect for listeners looking for a Jasad Heir book discussion or in-depth Sara Hashem analysis, as we explore how her world-building, magic system, and character dynamics position her among the next generation of standout Romantasy authors. Whether you’re drawn to stories of secret royalty, forbidden love, or morally gray magic, this conversation dives deep into what makes The Jasad Heir a must-read for fantasy fans and BookTok readers alike.\n\n\n\nThis season, we’ll be covering:The Hunger Games by Suzanne CollinsA Cruel Thirst by Angela MontoyaWhen the Moon Hatched by Sarah A. ParkerWhere the Shadows Meet by Patrice CaldwellBlood of Hercules by Jasmin MasBlood Over Bright Haven by M.L. WangRed Queen by Victoria AveyardThe Jasad Heir by Sara Hashem\n\nAnd when book club wraps up, get ready—our next full literary analysis will dive into Heir of Fire by Sarah J.

Book Talk for BookTok with Jac and Amy is the go-to literary podcast to discuss your favorite novels with your newest book-besties. They use their literary backgrounds to analyze what makes these stories so special and why the writing resonates with readers. Join them in taking modern women-written books seriously."

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, particularly The Fellowship of the Ring. One academic study analyzes Frodo's journey through the lens of Joseph Campbell's monomyth, detailing how his quest aligns with stages like the call to adventure, supernatural aid, and atonement with the father. Another academic source and Reddit discussions examine the influences of various myths and legends, especially Norse and Arthurian, on Tolkien's world-building, while also addressing his complex and often debated stance on allegory versus applicability in his narratives. Furthermore, a literary analysis investigates the internal and external conflicts experienced by Frodo within the novel, such as his struggle against himself, other characters, nature, and societal norms. Reviews of The Fellowship of the Ring from critics like W.H. Auden and a Reddit user provide perspectives on the novel's pacing, world-building, prose, and structure, including the concept of Frodo's \"Homely Houses.\""

                "standard": "Kurt Braddock's new book Weaponized Words: The Strategic Role of Persuasion in Violent Radicalization and Counter-Radicalization (Cambridge University Press, 2020) applies existing theories of persuasion to domains unique to this digital era, such as social media, YouTube, websites, and message boards to name but a few. Terrorists deploy a range of communication methods and harness reliable communication theories to create strategic messages that persuade peaceful individuals to join their groups and engage in violence. While explaining how they accomplish this, the book lays out a blueprint for developing counter-messages perfectly designed to conquer such violent extremism and terrorism. Using this basis in persuasion theory, a socio-scientific approach is generated to fight terrorist propaganda and the damage it causes.\n--Describes four key theories and perspectives related to persuasion and how they relate to radicalization and counter-radicalization.\n--Identifies future challenges that security officials will face in trying to stop terrorist messaging from promoting violent radicalization.\n--Suggests future directions that security officials, researchers, and policymakers can take persuasion theory to develop effective counter-messaging campaigns.\nBeth Windisch is a national security practitioner.

                "standard": "Our guest this week is Dr. Jeannine Brown who’s got a new commentary out on Paul’s most popular epistle, Philippians! \n\nDr. Brown joins us to talk about Paul, Jesus, and a narrative understanding of the New Testament. Check it out, I think it was a fun conversation. \n\nThe letter to the Philippians illuminates a warm relationship between the apostle Paul and the Philippian believers. Despite difficult situations being experienced on both sides, Paul finds ample reason to celebrate what God in Christ has done and is doing in the believers' lives. Jeannine K. Brown's commentary on Philippians explores the themes of this epistle and how its message is still relevant to Christians in the twenty-first century. Brown shows how motifs of joy, contentment, and unity abound as Paul reminds the Philippians of the supreme value of knowing Jesus the Messiah, and she highlights their significance for shaping the contemporary church toward living more deeply in its identity in Christ. This Tyndale New Testament commentary examines the text section-by-section―exploring the context in which it was written, providing thoughtful commentary on the letter to the Philippians, and then unpacking its theology. It will leave you with a thorough understanding of the content and structure of Paul's writing, as well as its meaning and continued relevance. The Tyndale New Testament Commentaries are ideal resources for students and teachers of theology, as well as for preachers and individual Christians looking to delve deeper into the riches of Scripture. Insightful and comprehensive, Jeannine K. Brown's commentary on Philippians is a brilliant introduction that will give you a renewed appreciation for this rich Pauline epistle and a greater knowledge of why it is important to the Christian faith.\n\nJeannine K. Brown is professor of New Testament at Bethel Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. Her books include Scripture as Communication, The Gospels as Stories, and biblical commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew. She is also a coeditor of the second edition of The Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels. \n\nThis is a public episode.

                "standard": "In this episode, Ryan Glasgow, the founder and CEO of Sprig, shares his insights on product management and the impact of AI. He and Kyle discuss his background in product management and his experience scaling companies like Weebly and Vurb from startup to successful exit. Ryan also explains the importance of product market fit and how to determine if a product is meeting customer needs. We also explore the concept of feature market fit and the role of AI in analyzing user data. Ryan provides advice for aspiring founders and product managers and shares his recommendations for interesting podcasts and products. \nTakeaways\nPut in the time and gain experience in product management before starting a company.Product market fit is determined by how disappointed customers would be if the product no longer existed.Feature market fit is about understanding the importance of specific features to users, even if they are infrequently used.AI is revolutionizing product management by providing insights and analysis at scale.Consider using AI to analyze user data and gain deeper understanding of the product experience.Founders should focus on building enduring businesses and not just raising seed funding.Google Bard is an AI tool that has shown promise in providing accurate and real-time responses. OpenAI requires advanced prompt engineering and custom instructions, while Google provides more basic prompts and easier responses.Google's approach to product management focuses on polished consumer-grade experiences, while OpenAI's models require more hand-holding.The ease of use of AI models is becoming more apparent in Google's offerings, potentially impacting user preferences.The future outlook involves observing the race between OpenAI and Google in terms of mainstream adoption and product development.\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Background03:28 Getting into Product Management06:09 Starting as a Product Manager at Early Companies11:32 The Process of Patenting16:27 Understanding Product Market Fit20:03 The Importance of Feature Market Fit28:01 The Impact of AI on Product Management31:02 Incorporating AI into Product Insights42:24 Advice for Founding a Company47:18 Advice for Product Managers49:05 Interesting Recommendations50:12 Product Recommendations51:11 Comparison between OpenAI and Google52:42 Ease of Use and Product Management53:29 Conclusion and Future Outlook\nLinks from the Show:LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanglasgow/\nBooks: Competing Against Luck, Amp It Up\nWebsite: https://sprig.com/\n\nMore by Kyle:\nFollow Prodity on Twitter and TikTok\nFollow Kyle on Twitter and TikTok\nSign up for the Prodity Newsletter for more updates.\nKyle's writing on Medium\nProdity on Medium\nLike our podcast, consider Buying Us a Coffee or supporting us on Patreon"

                "standard": "After weeks of heavy, murder-laden cases, Isla takes us in a different, yet still crime-ridden, direction: the audacious world of rare book forgery.\nWe look at the incredible true story of Thomas James Wise, the celebrated 19th-century bibliophile who fooled collectors, museums, and even the British Museum itself. For decades, Wise posed as a gentleman scholar, building a reputation as England’s foremost rare book expert - while secretly forging first editions, inventing non-existent pamphlets, and even tearing pages out of priceless library books to perfect his scams.\nPlus: Dee and Isla take a detour into book-world quirks (yes, vellum, watermarks, and antique quiz questions all make an appearance), and wrap up with a themed Ink-quisition featuring author Claire Wilson’s Stephen King tattoo tribute.\nThis one proves that true crime doesn’t always need murder to shock and intrigue.\n👉 Listen now on all podcast platforms, YouTube, or via our website.SOURCES:\nThe Book Forger by Joseph Hone \nWikipedia\nUniversity of Oregon Book Blogs"

Meet Your Host... Katherine Burrows... Founder and CEO of Katherine Burrows Creative, creator of the Business Character Analysis, and Creative Content Strategist. As a lifelong writer and a professional copywriter for the last 12 years, I’ve noticed that so many coaches, speakers, and entrepreneurs really struggle to get the engagement and response they need from their content. That’s why I developed a really unique and powerful tool, specifically for entrepreneurs, speakers, and coaches, who are fed up with not achieving quality connections with their audience. Unlike a lot of other content creators, who still use formulas and metrics, I help my clients reveal the authentic character of themselves and their business, so their audience feels they identify with them instantly. If you’re finally ready to start building an authentic connection with your market, let’s have a cup of coffee and chat."
