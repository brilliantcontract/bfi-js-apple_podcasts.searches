We’ll dive into shocking letters sent to black prospective students, a five-step plan to keep them out, and the protests that followed. Learn how government intervention eventually forced the end of discrimination and explore why Mormon leaders were so uneasy with black students.

Her writing experiments with prose and often explores dreamstates, nonlinear narratives, and unconventional perspectives. She was truly an innovator on both stylistic and cultural levels. Her most acclaimed works include Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, and A Room of One’s Own.\n\nSynopsis \nA Room of One’s Own follows Woolf's semi-fictional pursuit to research the topic of Women and Fiction. Woolf walks the audience through her own discoveries and frustrations, particularly highlighting the patriarchal hindrances on women to freely create art.\n\nChapter Guide \nCh 1. The narrator (a fictionalized Woolf) is asked to speak on the topic of Women and Fiction and attempts to begin her research at the fictional University of Oxbridge, but is met with obstructions on the basis of her sex. She then attends a university luncheon.\nCh 2. (40:51) The narrator begins her research at the British Museum, and finds that although many books are written by men about women, none of the men seem to align on their opinions of them.\nCh 3. (1:11:45) The narrator finds there is little information on the lives of women in history, and constructs an unfortunate tale regarding Shakespeare’s fictional sister, Judith.\nCh 4. (1:42:07) She goes on to research the lives of prominent female novelists, and asserts that women’s circumstances and writing styles differ from men entirely, and are\ntherefore difficult to compare. \nCh 5. (2:23:16) The narrator studies the fictional Mary Carmichael’s novel \"Life’s Adventure\" and dissects the types of relationships between fictional female characters.\nCh 6. (2:53:32) The narrator stresses the importance of an androgynous mind in creative expression. She ends by reaffirming the need of women to have their own money and own space, and encourages them to write and be heard.\n\nFrench Translations \n(49:30) “Les femmes sont extrêmes; elles sont meilleures ou pires que les hommes\" : Women are extreme; they are better or worse than men.\n\nSubstitutions Made for Date and/or Offensive Language \n(54:19) “Person”\n(1:29:38) “Black woman\""

                "standard": "This episode addresses the elephant slouching on its phone in the corner of many literature classrooms. Mary Isbell (University of New Haven) describes her search for a solution to the student reading crisis, incorporating conversations recorded as she was writing Searching for Wonder: Teaching Literature with Student-Selected Texts. These conversations reveal the many reasons faculty may be hesitant to set aside their carefully curated reading lists. With her guests, Isbell explores the history of literature instruction, the firm hold of close reading on the teaching of literature, the role of scholarly expertise in the humanities classroom, and the challenge of assessing process in literature courses. Production support by Stefan Schöberlein (Texas A&M University-Central Texas). Transcript available at bit.ly/S0902Transcript.

He was born in Washington Place, New York and spent much of his childhood in Paris, London, and Geneva. James’s specialty was prose fiction, yet he found work in journalism as well; he produced 20 novels, 112 tales, and 12 plays. James wrote Daisy Miller in 1879 after settling in London. \n\nMajor Characters \nFrederick Winterbourne: Primary character. Young American man who has spent much of his life in Geneva. \nDaisy Miller: A vacationing young American woman known for her flirtation. \nMrs. Miller: Daisy’s subdued mother. \nRandolph Miller: Daisy’s nine-year-old brother. Prefers America over Europe.  \nMrs. Costello: Winterbourne’s aunt he stays with in Vevey and Rome. Disapproves of the Miller Family’s manners. \nEugenio: The Miller’s courier.  \nMr. Giovanelli: Daisy’s Roman courter. \nMrs. Walker: A friend of Winterbourne and the Miller Family’s host in Rome.  \n\nSynopsis \nOperating in third-person limited perspective, Daisy Miller is a novel of manners that follows ex-patriot Frederick Winterbourne’s attraction and curiosity of Daisy Miller, a coquette (woman who trifles with men’s affections) American girl scolded for her behavior in urbane European society. \n\nChapter Guide \nCh 1. Winterbourne and Daisy meet in Vivey. He finds her beautiful and flirtatious. The two make plans to spend a day at the Castle of Chillon.  \nCh 2. (24:03) Winterbourne finds Mrs. Costello does not approve of the Miller family. Winterbourne speaks in the garden of their hotel to Daisy and Mrs. Miller and attempts to \tgo on a late-night boat ride with Daisy. The pair later go to the Castle of Chillon by boat on an afternoon tour. Daisy asks Winterbourne to meet her in Rome in winter.\nCh 3. (56:00) Winter. David meets Mrs. Costello in Rome, and she informs him she remains in disapproval of the Miller family. He goes to meet a friend, Mrs. Walker, and \t\truns into the Millers. He accompanies Daisy on a stroll with Mr. Giovanelli.\nCh 4. (1:26) Winterbourne sees Daisy and Mr. Giovanelli at Mrs. Walker’s party, then on a stroll, and finally at the Colosseum. \n\nFrench Translations \n(27:57:00) “Tout bonnement!” : Quite simply! \n(1:28:30) “Elle s’affiche” : It’s on display. \n(1:41:25) “...and thinks Miss Miller a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies!” : and thinks Miss Miller a young lady who indulges her fantasies. \n(1:43:48) “...a young lady du meilleur monde” : a young lady of the best world."

Lots of it. Why? Because students who know more are able to read more, and read better.\nIn To Read Stuff You Have to Know Stuff, Kelly draws from his own teaching practice to share the importance of building students’ prior knowledge at four levels:\nWords: How building knowledge helps students to overcome word poverty\nSentences and Passages: How building knowledge helps students to comprehend “small” reading\nArticles: How building knowledge helps students to critically read articles―an important skill in our digital age\nBooks: How building knowledge moves students away from fake reading and back into reading full-length books \nTo Read Stuff You Have to Know Stuff also shows how students can monitor their own comprehension. They can see that many reading difficulties aren’t the result of not being a “good reader”― they simply lack knowledge.\nOur students are fortunate to live in an age where so much information is a click away. But to read well―and think well―they need to own that knowledge."

She also operates an educational consulting platform, the Center for Intentional Learning.\nHighlights:\n Chapter 2 is an overview of the published literature and discusses the sources in conversation with each other (which requires high-level cognitive skills that can be enhanced by self-care...but the way, how is your self-care?)It often takes longer than other sections because it requires a deep understanding of your field (and this takes TIME) - you are going from a passive consumer to an active creatorThis task requires high-level cognitive skills (how is your self-care?)The literature review is an evolving document - you will be revising and adding to this until your oral defense Think of this task as a puzzle and go through some systematic steps to build your chapter 2Gather your resources (these must be diverse and include multiple viewpoints )Organize your sources (you will want an organizational system for these)Scan your sources and only read  the ones relevant to your studyTake notes - you must do this in a systematic way (for example a synthesis matrix - more on that here: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1547113/9643971Mind map or outline to get a picture of how your story is going to be told - this is important - DO NOT SKIP THIS!! Share this with your chair before you write.Review your matrix focusing on synthesis. You must maintain your academic voice - Chapter 2 is not a book report or an annotated bibliography.  Think of synthesis as a conversation among the authors of the research you are reading. What are they agreeing about? Disagreeing about?Start writing! Write in whatever order works for you - once you have an outline, follow the outline, but don't force yourself to write from beginning to end in a linear fashion (unless that works for you!)Trust yourself and the process!Seek out and accept feedbackResist rabbit holesStay sane (remember that self-care thing?)Adopt this mantra: Better today than yesterday Connect with Ellen\nhttps://twitter.com/en_beattie\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/enbeattie/\n\nEllen's publication mentioned in intro: The Power of the Positive: Enhancing Online Student Engagement for Adult Literacy Learners, is highlighted in Adult Literacy Education: The International Journal of Literacy, Language, and Numeracy.  \n\n\nSupport the show\nSupport this free content: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1547113/supporters/new \nGet The Happy Doc Student Handbook: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578333732\nOther resources at: http://Expandyourhappy.com \n\nWant to make my day?

She demonstrates grief to her surrounding family and friends. However, she secretly pleasures in the idea that she is now a well-off widow, as she remembers having a loveless and passionless marriage that she endured for the sake of having physical and financial stability. However, the husband returns home, as it is revealed that his train was confused with the train that was truly a part of the accident. Unfortunately, the main character dies from the shock of her husband’s return. \n\nThemes and Ideas in The Story of an Hour\nFemininity and Marriage\nFreedom in Relation to Marriage\nExpected Roles and Responsibilities of Wives\nFemale Sexuality, specifically as a Married Woman\nExistence, Death, and Loss\nGrief and the Etiquette of Grief \nFinancially Stability and Its Presence in a Woman’s Life\nWidowhood \n\nBiography of Kate Chopin (1850-1904)\nCatherine “Kate” O’Flaherty Chopin was born on February 8, 1850 in St. Louis, Missouri to Thomas O’Flaherty and Eliza (née Faris) O’Flaherty. Because her mother was of a French background, Chopin became fluent in both English and French, and she later was greatly influenced by French culture, especially in terms of literature. Her first story appeared in papers in 1889, but she privately published her first novel At Fault in 1890. Soon, Chopin began to associate with the St. Louis literary social circle and interacted with the likes of Fredirich Hegel, Emile Zola, and Geroge Sand. Chopin continued to work on her writing and was successful in making profit off of her stories. Short story collections like Bayou Folk (1894), which includes both “The Story of an Hour” and “Desiree’s Baby”, and A Night in Acadie (1897) were critically-acclaimed, but her best-known work The Awakening (1898) received an on-pouring of disapproval and disgust. It was not until the 1960s that Chopin’s magnum opus received positive recognition and was not viewed as a lurid tale displaying female sexuality. Unfortunately, Chopin would never witness this success of The Awakening and her many short stories as she died on August 22, 1904. Kate Chopin is now regarded as a classic American author that presents women, their societal value, and their sexuality in a manner propelled the feminist movement to the point it has reached today (see https://www.katechopin.org/biography/)"

The founders of Hillsdale College understood, like the founders of our great nation, that free government requires independent, virtuous, and knowledgeable citizens.\n\nThe Hillsdale College Podcast Network (HCPN) exists to support Hillsdale’s mission, offering nationwide access to Hillsdale’s audio content. The HCPN helps radiate the learning, teaching, and discussions that happen here on campus to people everywhere. Supported by you, our listeners, we seek to invite you into the conversation about “the best that has been thought and said.”\n\nThe HCPN includes five shows: The Larry P. Arnn Show, Hillsdale Dialogues, The Radio Free Hillsdale Hour, Beyond the Bubble, and the Hillsdale College K-12 Classical Education Podcast, with additional shows being planned for launch in the coming year."

Her writing experiments with prose and often explores dreamstates, nonlinear narratives, and unconventional perspectives. She was truly an innovator on both stylistic and cultural levels. Her most acclaimed works include Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, and A Room of One’s Own.\n\nSynopsis \nA Room of One’s Own follows Woolf's semi-fictional pursuit to research the topic of Women and Fiction. Woolf walks the audience through her own discoveries and frustrations, particularly highlighting the patriarchal hindrances on women to freely create art.\n\nChapter Guide \nCh 1. The narrator (a fictionalized Woolf) is asked to speak on the topic of Women and Fiction and attempts to begin her research at the fictional University of Oxbridge, but is met with obstructions on the basis of her sex. She then attends a university luncheon.\nCh 2. (40:51) The narrator begins her research at the British Museum, and finds that although many books are written by men about women, none of the men seem to align on their opinions of them.\nCh 3. (1:11:45) The narrator finds there is little information on the lives of women in history, and constructs an unfortunate tale regarding Shakespeare’s fictional sister, Judith.\nCh 4. (1:42:07) She goes on to research the lives of prominent female novelists, and asserts that women’s circumstances and writing styles differ from men entirely, and are\ntherefore difficult to compare. \nCh 5. (2:23:16) The narrator studies the fictional Mary Carmichael’s novel \"Life’s Adventure\" and dissects the types of relationships between fictional female characters.\nCh 6. (2:53:32) The narrator stresses the importance of an androgynous mind in creative expression. She ends by reaffirming the need of women to have their own money and own space, and encourages them to write and be heard.\n\nFrench Translations \n(49:30) “Les femmes sont extrêmes; elles sont meilleures ou pires que les hommes\" : Women are extreme; they are better or worse than men.\n\nSubstitutions Made for Date and/or Offensive Language \n(54:19) “Person”\n(1:29:38) “Black woman\""

                "standard": "This episode addresses the elephant slouching on its phone in the corner of many literature classrooms. Mary Isbell (University of New Haven) describes her search for a solution to the student reading crisis, incorporating conversations recorded as she was writing Searching for Wonder: Teaching Literature with Student-Selected Texts. These conversations reveal the many reasons faculty may be hesitant to set aside their carefully curated reading lists. With her guests, Isbell explores the history of literature instruction, the firm hold of close reading on the teaching of literature, the role of scholarly expertise in the humanities classroom, and the challenge of assessing process in literature courses. Production support by Stefan Schöberlein (Texas A&M University-Central Texas). Transcript available at bit.ly/S0902Transcript.

He was born in Washington Place, New York and spent much of his childhood in Paris, London, and Geneva. James’s specialty was prose fiction, yet he found work in journalism as well; he produced 20 novels, 112 tales, and 12 plays. James wrote Daisy Miller in 1879 after settling in London. \n\nMajor Characters \nFrederick Winterbourne: Primary character. Young American man who has spent much of his life in Geneva. \nDaisy Miller: A vacationing young American woman known for her flirtation. \nMrs. Miller: Daisy’s subdued mother. \nRandolph Miller: Daisy’s nine-year-old brother. Prefers America over Europe.  \nMrs. Costello: Winterbourne’s aunt he stays with in Vevey and Rome. Disapproves of the Miller Family’s manners. \nEugenio: The Miller’s courier.  \nMr. Giovanelli: Daisy’s Roman courter. \nMrs. Walker: A friend of Winterbourne and the Miller Family’s host in Rome.  \n\nSynopsis \nOperating in third-person limited perspective, Daisy Miller is a novel of manners that follows ex-patriot Frederick Winterbourne’s attraction and curiosity of Daisy Miller, a coquette (woman who trifles with men’s affections) American girl scolded for her behavior in urbane European society. \n\nChapter Guide \nCh 1. Winterbourne and Daisy meet in Vivey. He finds her beautiful and flirtatious. The two make plans to spend a day at the Castle of Chillon.  \nCh 2. (24:03) Winterbourne finds Mrs. Costello does not approve of the Miller family. Winterbourne speaks in the garden of their hotel to Daisy and Mrs. Miller and attempts to \tgo on a late-night boat ride with Daisy. The pair later go to the Castle of Chillon by boat on an afternoon tour. Daisy asks Winterbourne to meet her in Rome in winter.\nCh 3. (56:00) Winter. David meets Mrs. Costello in Rome, and she informs him she remains in disapproval of the Miller family. He goes to meet a friend, Mrs. Walker, and \t\truns into the Millers. He accompanies Daisy on a stroll with Mr. Giovanelli.\nCh 4. (1:26) Winterbourne sees Daisy and Mr. Giovanelli at Mrs. Walker’s party, then on a stroll, and finally at the Colosseum. \n\nFrench Translations \n(27:57:00) “Tout bonnement!” : Quite simply! \n(1:28:30) “Elle s’affiche” : It’s on display. \n(1:41:25) “...and thinks Miss Miller a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies!” : and thinks Miss Miller a young lady who indulges her fantasies. \n(1:43:48) “...a young lady du meilleur monde” : a young lady of the best world."

Lots of it. Why? Because students who know more are able to read more, and read better.\nIn To Read Stuff You Have to Know Stuff, Kelly draws from his own teaching practice to share the importance of building students’ prior knowledge at four levels:\nWords: How building knowledge helps students to overcome word poverty\nSentences and Passages: How building knowledge helps students to comprehend “small” reading\nArticles: How building knowledge helps students to critically read articles―an important skill in our digital age\nBooks: How building knowledge moves students away from fake reading and back into reading full-length books \nTo Read Stuff You Have to Know Stuff also shows how students can monitor their own comprehension. They can see that many reading difficulties aren’t the result of not being a “good reader”― they simply lack knowledge.\nOur students are fortunate to live in an age where so much information is a click away. But to read well―and think well―they need to own that knowledge."

She also operates an educational consulting platform, the Center for Intentional Learning.\nHighlights:\n Chapter 2 is an overview of the published literature and discusses the sources in conversation with each other (which requires high-level cognitive skills that can be enhanced by self-care...but the way, how is your self-care?)It often takes longer than other sections because it requires a deep understanding of your field (and this takes TIME) - you are going from a passive consumer to an active creatorThis task requires high-level cognitive skills (how is your self-care?)The literature review is an evolving document - you will be revising and adding to this until your oral defense Think of this task as a puzzle and go through some systematic steps to build your chapter 2Gather your resources (these must be diverse and include multiple viewpoints )Organize your sources (you will want an organizational system for these)Scan your sources and only read  the ones relevant to your studyTake notes - you must do this in a systematic way (for example a synthesis matrix - more on that here: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1547113/9643971Mind map or outline to get a picture of how your story is going to be told - this is important - DO NOT SKIP THIS!! Share this with your chair before you write.Review your matrix focusing on synthesis. You must maintain your academic voice - Chapter 2 is not a book report or an annotated bibliography.  Think of synthesis as a conversation among the authors of the research you are reading. What are they agreeing about? Disagreeing about?Start writing! Write in whatever order works for you - once you have an outline, follow the outline, but don't force yourself to write from beginning to end in a linear fashion (unless that works for you!)Trust yourself and the process!Seek out and accept feedbackResist rabbit holesStay sane (remember that self-care thing?)Adopt this mantra: Better today than yesterday Connect with Ellen\nhttps://twitter.com/en_beattie\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/enbeattie/\n\nEllen's publication mentioned in intro: The Power of the Positive: Enhancing Online Student Engagement for Adult Literacy Learners, is highlighted in Adult Literacy Education: The International Journal of Literacy, Language, and Numeracy.  \n\n\nSupport the show\nSupport this free content: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1547113/supporters/new \nGet The Happy Doc Student Handbook: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578333732\nOther resources at: http://Expandyourhappy.com \n\nWant to make my day?

She demonstrates grief to her surrounding family and friends. However, she secretly pleasures in the idea that she is now a well-off widow, as she remembers having a loveless and passionless marriage that she endured for the sake of having physical and financial stability. However, the husband returns home, as it is revealed that his train was confused with the train that was truly a part of the accident. Unfortunately, the main character dies from the shock of her husband’s return. \n\nThemes and Ideas in The Story of an Hour\nFemininity and Marriage\nFreedom in Relation to Marriage\nExpected Roles and Responsibilities of Wives\nFemale Sexuality, specifically as a Married Woman\nExistence, Death, and Loss\nGrief and the Etiquette of Grief \nFinancially Stability and Its Presence in a Woman’s Life\nWidowhood \n\nBiography of Kate Chopin (1850-1904)\nCatherine “Kate” O’Flaherty Chopin was born on February 8, 1850 in St. Louis, Missouri to Thomas O’Flaherty and Eliza (née Faris) O’Flaherty. Because her mother was of a French background, Chopin became fluent in both English and French, and she later was greatly influenced by French culture, especially in terms of literature. Her first story appeared in papers in 1889, but she privately published her first novel At Fault in 1890. Soon, Chopin began to associate with the St. Louis literary social circle and interacted with the likes of Fredirich Hegel, Emile Zola, and Geroge Sand. Chopin continued to work on her writing and was successful in making profit off of her stories. Short story collections like Bayou Folk (1894), which includes both “The Story of an Hour” and “Desiree’s Baby”, and A Night in Acadie (1897) were critically-acclaimed, but her best-known work The Awakening (1898) received an on-pouring of disapproval and disgust. It was not until the 1960s that Chopin’s magnum opus received positive recognition and was not viewed as a lurid tale displaying female sexuality. Unfortunately, Chopin would never witness this success of The Awakening and her many short stories as she died on August 22, 1904. Kate Chopin is now regarded as a classic American author that presents women, their societal value, and their sexuality in a manner propelled the feminist movement to the point it has reached today (see https://www.katechopin.org/biography/)"
