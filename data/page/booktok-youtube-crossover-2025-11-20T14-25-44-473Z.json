Then we need to talk about someone announcing their upcoming Arena Spectacular, it’s Em, she’s taking over MC (Mariah Carey) Arena, Saturday December 7, to deliver ‘Outgrown the Arena Spectacular’, with side quests on Chappell Roan and Kesha thrown in. Speaking of Arenas, we follow that with the news that Celine clapped back at Donald Trump with a sassy statement after he used ‘My Heart Will Go On’ at one of his rallies. We also need to delve into the bizarre revelation that US Presidential candidate RFK Jr dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park back in 2014, because why wouldn’t he do something like that? After that we're keen to talk about the trainwreck of a PR campaign happening for the new movie based on the beloved #BookTok book ‘It Ends With Us’. There’s a LOT to unpack involving the movie’s star Blake Lively, costar and director Justin Baldoni and even Blake’s husband Ryan Reynolds and his ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ co-star Hugh Jackman. Finally we need to talk through some of our fave moments from the Closing Ceremony in Paris as well as doing an ‘Okay, Stop!’ on that very unique appearance from Tom Cruise. Then in our Sealed Section, on our premium service Emsolation Extra, Em and Michael talk about Rachael Gunn, aka Raygun’s performance during the breakdancing competition at the Games.

Then we need to talk about someone announcing their upcoming Arena Spectacular, it’s Em, she’s taking over MC (Mariah Carey) Arena, Saturday December 7, to deliver ‘Outgrown the Arena Spectacular’, with side quests on Chappell Roan and Kesha thrown in. Speaking of Arenas, we follow that with the news that Celine clapped back at Donald Trump with a sassy statement after he used ‘My Heart Will Go On’ at one of his rallies. We also need to delve into the bizarre revelation that US Presidential candidate RFK Jr dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park back in 2014, because why wouldn’t he do something like that? After that we're keen to talk about the trainwreck of a PR campaign happening for the new movie based on the beloved #BookTok book ‘It Ends With Us’. There’s a LOT to unpack involving the movie’s star Blake Lively, costar and director Justin Baldoni and even Blake’s husband Ryan Reynolds and his ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ co-star Hugh Jackman. Finally we need to talk through some of our fave moments from the Closing Ceremony in Paris as well as doing an ‘Okay, Stop!’ on that very unique appearance from Tom Cruise. Then in our Sealed Section, on our premium service Emsolation Extra, Em and Michael talk about Rachael Gunn, aka Raygun’s performance during the breakdancing competition at the Games.

This is Part 1. Stick around Thursdays for Part 2.\n\n\n\nThey use their combined 13 years of literary academic training to analyze and give voice to reasons why you may love or hate today's popular books. They embrace and respect modern fantasy, romance, and romantasy books written by women. And so, it is in their nature to analyze these books as you would any other novel you might have discussed in school. \n\n\n\nSpring Book Club Roster: Onyx Storm by Rebecca Yarros / Lore of the Wilds by Analeigh Sbrana / Quicksilver by Cali Hart / Nine Tailed by Jayci Lee / A Fate Inked in Blood by Danielle Jensen / We Hunt the Flame by Hafsah Faizal / Powerless by Lauren Robers / The Vampire's Bargain by Jasmine Walt \n\n\n\nWhat's to come?\n\nStick around when we're done with Book Club! We'll be doing a 10-part literary analysis on Sarah J. Maas' Crown of Midnight.\n\n\n\nSponsors: \n\nThank you Lumen for sponsoring this episode!

Maybe you’ve even felt embarrassed about what you’re reading because it isn’t considered a “classic” by people you know. Book Talk for BookTok with Jac and Amy is the go-to literary podcast to discuss your favorite novels with your newest book-besties. They use their literary backgrounds to analyze what makes these stories so special and why the writing resonates with readers. Join them in taking modern women-written books seriously."

Agatha Christie, of course: the Queen of Crime, a real-life Dame of the British Empire, and author of sixty-six mystery novels that spanned the Twentieth Century, defining a genre. For five years, Catherine Brobeck and Kemper Donovan revisited these novels in publication order, ranking them according to pre-set criteria (plot, character, etc.). Tragically, Catherine Brobeck passed away at the end of 2021. Since then, Kemper has completed the podcast's ranking project, and now contents himself with celebrating the greatness of Christie by attempting to solve the ultimate mystery where she is concerned. Why Christie--and Christie alone--endures as powerfully as she does."

Then we need to talk about someone announcing their upcoming Arena Spectacular, it’s Em, she’s taking over MC (Mariah Carey) Arena, Saturday December 7, to deliver ‘Outgrown the Arena Spectacular’, with side quests on Chappell Roan and Kesha thrown in. Speaking of Arenas, we follow that with the news that Celine clapped back at Donald Trump with a sassy statement after he used ‘My Heart Will Go On’ at one of his rallies. We also need to delve into the bizarre revelation that US Presidential candidate RFK Jr dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park back in 2014, because why wouldn’t he do something like that? After that we're keen to talk about the trainwreck of a PR campaign happening for the new movie based on the beloved #BookTok book ‘It Ends With Us’. There’s a LOT to unpack involving the movie’s star Blake Lively, costar and director Justin Baldoni and even Blake’s husband Ryan Reynolds and his ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ co-star Hugh Jackman. Finally we need to talk through some of our fave moments from the Closing Ceremony in Paris as well as doing an ‘Okay, Stop!’ on that very unique appearance from Tom Cruise. Then in our Sealed Section, on our premium service Emsolation Extra, Em and Michael talk about Rachael Gunn, aka Raygun’s performance during the breakdancing competition at the Games.

Then we need to talk about someone announcing their upcoming Arena Spectacular, it’s Em, she’s taking over MC (Mariah Carey) Arena, Saturday December 7, to deliver ‘Outgrown the Arena Spectacular’, with side quests on Chappell Roan and Kesha thrown in. Speaking of Arenas, we follow that with the news that Celine clapped back at Donald Trump with a sassy statement after he used ‘My Heart Will Go On’ at one of his rallies. We also need to delve into the bizarre revelation that US Presidential candidate RFK Jr dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park back in 2014, because why wouldn’t he do something like that? After that we're keen to talk about the trainwreck of a PR campaign happening for the new movie based on the beloved #BookTok book ‘It Ends With Us’. There’s a LOT to unpack involving the movie’s star Blake Lively, costar and director Justin Baldoni and even Blake’s husband Ryan Reynolds and his ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ co-star Hugh Jackman. Finally we need to talk through some of our fave moments from the Closing Ceremony in Paris as well as doing an ‘Okay, Stop!’ on that very unique appearance from Tom Cruise. Then in our Sealed Section, on our premium service Emsolation Extra, Em and Michael talk about Rachael Gunn, aka Raygun’s performance during the breakdancing competition at the Games.

This is Part 1. Stick around Thursdays for Part 2.\n\n\n\nThey use their combined 13 years of literary academic training to analyze and give voice to reasons why you may love or hate today's popular books. They embrace and respect modern fantasy, romance, and romantasy books written by women. And so, it is in their nature to analyze these books as you would any other novel you might have discussed in school. \n\n\n\nSpring Book Club Roster: Onyx Storm by Rebecca Yarros / Lore of the Wilds by Analeigh Sbrana / Quicksilver by Cali Hart / Nine Tailed by Jayci Lee / A Fate Inked in Blood by Danielle Jensen / We Hunt the Flame by Hafsah Faizal / Powerless by Lauren Robers / The Vampire's Bargain by Jasmine Walt \n\n\n\nWhat's to come?\n\nStick around when we're done with Book Club!

Or finished a heart-stopping scene only to look around and not be able to talk to anyone about it? Maybe you’ve even felt embarrassed about what you’re reading because it isn’t considered a “classic” by people you know. Book Talk for BookTok with Jac and Amy is the go-to literary podcast to discuss your favorite novels with your newest book-besties. They use their literary backgrounds to analyze what makes these stories so special and why the writing resonates with readers. Join them in taking modern women-written books seriously."
