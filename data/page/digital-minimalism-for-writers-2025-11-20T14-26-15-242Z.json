In today’s episode, Cal looks at one implication of Sora 2 in particular that is both important but currently overcooked: the impact of AI content generation on the existing social media giants. He then answers listener questions on AI and social media and reacts to a new Sam Altman tweet that signals bad news for OpenAI.\nBelow are the questions covered in today's episode (with their timestamps).

                "standard": "In the Journal, Computers and Human Behavior, a study on divided attention and social media stated “The fundamental tenet of cognitive load theory is that the quality of instructional design will be raised if greater consideration is given to the role and limitations of working memory”.\n\nSo in the Age of Distraction, what is our current working memory? In the summer of 2015, Microsoft published a report that argued the widespread usage of smartphones has led to the deterioration of attention span from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds. That was four years ago. Is it less now?\n\nTherefore, this exploration of Digital Minimalism, Essentialism, and Learning was a very timely – and personal – exploration into our relationships with technology. Our guest Christiana Houck recently made a journey in to minimalism and has integrated it into her digital lifestyle as well.\n\nEssentialism is a bit different. Minimalism’s focus is on paring down materials and environment to get rid of the clutter. Essentialism’s focus is to direct energy only on the things that matter; concentrate on less, but better. It’s differentiating between the background noise and the relevant, now an art or skill as technology continues to be more pervasive in our lives.\n\nSo in this TLDCast, we had an informal discussion about Christiana Houck’s background and her journey into a Minimalist mindset. Christiana is a Learning Solutions Director for a large gaming company and is responsible for training dozens of technicians to support their gaming machines that are located all over the world. Gaming machines, in particular, slot machines, are geared for distraction, and that irony is not lost on Christiana.\n\nWe discussed the three Digital Minimalist principles:\n\nTechnology use should be intentional not habitual.\nTechnology is for making stuff not feeling better.\nTechnology should never come before people.\nWe also talked about the considerations Instructional Designers may have in building their training. For example, Christian deTorres commented:\n\nTo address user distraction: Chunk training into smaller modules. I open up with scenarios and short quizzes that most people get wrong–which I feel perks them up as they realize this isn’t something they already know.\n\nCheck out our blog post for more information: https://tldc.us/2019/04/12/digital-minimalism-essentialism-and-learning-with-christiana-houck/"

He previously earned his Ph.D. from MIT in 2009 and graduated from Dartmouth College in 2004.\nIn addition to studying the theoretical foundations of our digital age as a professor, Newport also writes about the impact of these technologies on the world of work.\nHis most recent book, Deep Work, argues that focus is the new I.Q. in the knowledge economy, and that individuals who cultivate their ability to concentrate without distraction will thrive.\nThe original post is located here: https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2019/03/01/digital-minimalism-for-parents/\nVisit Me Online at OLDPodcast.com \nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "standard": "It's become increasingly harder to just put the phone down. Because the latest apps and digital platforms are specifically designed to addict, we have become slaves to their irresistible allure.\nOur precious attention is being hijacked. The ability to focus — to concentrate on that which is most meaningful — simply cannot compete with the magnetic pull of our Instagram feed. No longer need anyone ever be bored. Alone with one’s thoughts. Or simply present with one’s self. \nThe result is a global epidemic of distraction. A fomenting of loneliness and isolation. And a degradation of our humanity.\nThe solution isn't Ludditism. Instead it's agency. We need not be victims of technology. We have the power to liberate ourselves from the tether of digital dependency. And the freedom it creates isn't just the salve to what ails us, it's the gateway to that which we seek most. Meaning. True human connection. And a reconnection with our innate humanity.\nIndeed, there is no substitute for real relationships. Boredom is useful. And focus is the new superpower.\nCal Newport is someone who has spent a lot of time thinking deeply about these issues.\nAn associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University, Cal is the author of six books, many of which focus on the impact of technology on society. The primary focus of today's conversation is rooted in his latest New York Times bestseller, Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World*.\nCal’s work has been published in over 20 languages. He is a frequent guest on NPR and has been featured in many major publications, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New Yorker, Washington Post, and Economist.\n\nRegular listeners know I have a penchant for dropping Cal's name with regularity. I became acquainted with his work in early 2016 by way of his seminal book, Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in A Distracted World* — pages that profoundly impacted how I think about and apply my attention. We struck up an e-mail friendship. And I’ve been trying to track him down for the podcast ever since.\nPeople often ask me which books have influenced me the most. The aforementioned two rank close to the top — manifestos of great practical import for our modern age. Similarly, I estimate that this episode rates among the most consequential conversations I've had in the 6+ year history of this podcast. Packed with practical, actionable steps, Cal's message will empower you to free up precious time. Declutter your mind. Connect you more deeply to the work and relationships you care most about. And profoundly improve the quality of your professional and personal lives.\nIt was an absolute pleasure to spend time with Cal. I sincerely hope you not only enjoy the listen, but heed his message, and put his advice into action.\nThe visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/calnewport447 (please subscribe!)\nPeace + Plants,\nRich"

The Art Life is a podcast and emerging philosophy exploring what it means to be an artist.\n\nEach episode questions what art has to do with life: from nature to notebooks, from happiness to home renovations.\n\nYour host Grace Gordon shares stories of how art weaves meaning into all that we do. 'Being an artist' can be a job, but also an identity, a lifestyle, and a reminder to spend time away from screens. \n\nIn conversation, The Art Life redefines ‘art’ as expansive, inclusive, and grounding.\n\nThis show is for everyone because everyone can be an artist. Tune in for art chats and interviews. We hope you’re inspired to adopt an art life of your own."

The Art Life is a podcast and emerging philosophy exploring what it means to be an artist.\n\nEach episode questions what art has to do with life: from nature to notebooks, from happiness to home renovations.\n\nYour host Grace Gordon shares stories of how art weaves meaning into all that we do. 'Being an artist' can be a job, but also an identity, a lifestyle, and a reminder to spend time away from screens. \n\nIn conversation, The Art Life redefines ‘art’ as expansive, inclusive, and grounding.\n\nThis show is for everyone because everyone can be an artist. Tune in for art chats and interviews. We hope you’re inspired to adopt an art life of your own."

In today’s episode, Cal looks at one implication of Sora 2 in particular that is both important but currently overcooked: the impact of AI content generation on the existing social media giants. He then answers listener questions on AI and social media and reacts to a new Sam Altman tweet that signals bad news for OpenAI.\nBelow are the questions covered in today's episode (with their timestamps).

                "standard": "In the Journal, Computers and Human Behavior, a study on divided attention and social media stated “The fundamental tenet of cognitive load theory is that the quality of instructional design will be raised if greater consideration is given to the role and limitations of working memory”.\n\nSo in the Age of Distraction, what is our current working memory? In the summer of 2015, Microsoft published a report that argued the widespread usage of smartphones has led to the deterioration of attention span from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds. That was four years ago. Is it less now?\n\nTherefore, this exploration of Digital Minimalism, Essentialism, and Learning was a very timely – and personal – exploration into our relationships with technology. Our guest Christiana Houck recently made a journey in to minimalism and has integrated it into her digital lifestyle as well.\n\nEssentialism is a bit different. Minimalism’s focus is on paring down materials and environment to get rid of the clutter. Essentialism’s focus is to direct energy only on the things that matter; concentrate on less, but better. It’s differentiating between the background noise and the relevant, now an art or skill as technology continues to be more pervasive in our lives.\n\nSo in this TLDCast, we had an informal discussion about Christiana Houck’s background and her journey into a Minimalist mindset. Christiana is a Learning Solutions Director for a large gaming company and is responsible for training dozens of technicians to support their gaming machines that are located all over the world. Gaming machines, in particular, slot machines, are geared for distraction, and that irony is not lost on Christiana.\n\nWe discussed the three Digital Minimalist principles:\n\nTechnology use should be intentional not habitual.\nTechnology is for making stuff not feeling better.\nTechnology should never come before people.\nWe also talked about the considerations Instructional Designers may have in building their training. For example, Christian deTorres commented:\n\nTo address user distraction: Chunk training into smaller modules. I open up with scenarios and short quizzes that most people get wrong–which I feel perks them up as they realize this isn’t something they already know.\n\nCheck out our blog post for more information: https://tldc.us/2019/04/12/digital-minimalism-essentialism-and-learning-with-christiana-houck/"

He previously earned his Ph.D. from MIT in 2009 and graduated from Dartmouth College in 2004.\nIn addition to studying the theoretical foundations of our digital age as a professor, Newport also writes about the impact of these technologies on the world of work.\nHis most recent book, Deep Work, argues that focus is the new I.Q. in the knowledge economy, and that individuals who cultivate their ability to concentrate without distraction will thrive.\nThe original post is located here: https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2019/03/01/digital-minimalism-for-parents/\nVisit Me Online at OLDPodcast.com \nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "standard": "It's become increasingly harder to just put the phone down. Because the latest apps and digital platforms are specifically designed to addict, we have become slaves to their irresistible allure.\nOur precious attention is being hijacked. The ability to focus — to concentrate on that which is most meaningful — simply cannot compete with the magnetic pull of our Instagram feed. No longer need anyone ever be bored. Alone with one’s thoughts. Or simply present with one’s self. \nThe result is a global epidemic of distraction. A fomenting of loneliness and isolation. And a degradation of our humanity.\nThe solution isn't Ludditism. Instead it's agency. We need not be victims of technology. We have the power to liberate ourselves from the tether of digital dependency. And the freedom it creates isn't just the salve to what ails us, it's the gateway to that which we seek most. Meaning. True human connection. And a reconnection with our innate humanity.\nIndeed, there is no substitute for real relationships. Boredom is useful. And focus is the new superpower.\nCal Newport is someone who has spent a lot of time thinking deeply about these issues.\nAn associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University, Cal is the author of six books, many of which focus on the impact of technology on society. The primary focus of today's conversation is rooted in his latest New York Times bestseller, Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World*.\nCal’s work has been published in over 20 languages. He is a frequent guest on NPR and has been featured in many major publications, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New Yorker, Washington Post, and Economist.\n\nRegular listeners know I have a penchant for dropping Cal's name with regularity. I became acquainted with his work in early 2016 by way of his seminal book, Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in A Distracted World* — pages that profoundly impacted how I think about and apply my attention. We struck up an e-mail friendship. And I’ve been trying to track him down for the podcast ever since.\nPeople often ask me which books have influenced me the most. The aforementioned two rank close to the top — manifestos of great practical import for our modern age. Similarly, I estimate that this episode rates among the most consequential conversations I've had in the 6+ year history of this podcast. Packed with practical, actionable steps, Cal's message will empower you to free up precious time. Declutter your mind. Connect you more deeply to the work and relationships you care most about. And profoundly improve the quality of your professional and personal lives.\nIt was an absolute pleasure to spend time with Cal. I sincerely hope you not only enjoy the listen, but heed his message, and put his advice into action.\nThe visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/calnewport447 (please subscribe!)\nPeace + Plants,\nRich"

The Art Life is a podcast and emerging philosophy exploring what it means to be an artist.\n\nEach episode questions what art has to do with life: from nature to notebooks, from happiness to home renovations.\n\nYour host Grace Gordon shares stories of how art weaves meaning into all that we do. 'Being an artist' can be a job, but also an identity, a lifestyle, and a reminder to spend time away from screens. \n\nIn conversation, The Art Life redefines ‘art’ as expansive, inclusive, and grounding.\n\nThis show is for everyone because everyone can be an artist. Tune in for art chats and interviews. We hope you’re inspired to adopt an art life of your own."

It isn’t as tightly constructed as say Norse Mythology or Greek Mythology. What do you think about this?Cuchulainn is used as a propaganda tool by Northern Ireland.
