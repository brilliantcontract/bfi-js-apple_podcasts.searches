For the past few months, the Refit Crew has been discussing at length, the Original Series Era movies while navigating towards their final destination of BEYOND at temporal coordinates 07.22.16. After nearly 4 years of the critical and financial success of the 2009 Reboot, INTO DARKNESS roared back onto the big screen.\n Even though it was the highest ever grossing Star Trek movie, earning over $467 million dollars worldwide, many “Trekkies” believed that this movie was the furthest from Gene Roddenberry’s original vision. The themes of this movie were of a darker tone, challenging not only veteran Trekkies, but a modern audience as well as INTO DARKNESS presented a future that was quite different from The Original Series source material. INTO DARKNESS definitely ushered in a new era of Star Trek cinematic storytelling. And then there was the \"wrath\" of Khan...or was it the \"wrath\" of the fans?\n Hosts Ken Tripp, Jeffrey Harlan and Zach Moore\n Feature Welcome to Standard Orbit!

For the past few months, the Refit Crew has been discussing at length, the Original Series Era movies while navigating towards their final destination of BEYOND at temporal coordinates 07.22.16. After nearly 4 years of the critical and financial success of the 2009 Reboot, INTO DARKNESS roared back onto the big screen.\n Even though it was the highest ever grossing Star Trek movie, earning over $467 million dollars worldwide, many “Trekkies” believed that this movie was the furthest from Gene Roddenberry’s original vision. The themes of this movie were of a darker tone, challenging not only veteran Trekkies, but a modern audience as well as INTO DARKNESS presented a future that was quite different from The Original Series source material. INTO DARKNESS definitely ushered in a new era of Star Trek cinematic storytelling. And then there was the \"wrath\" of Khan...or was it the \"wrath\" of the fans?\n Hosts Ken Tripp, Jeffrey Harlan and Zach Moore\n Feature Welcome to Standard Orbit!
